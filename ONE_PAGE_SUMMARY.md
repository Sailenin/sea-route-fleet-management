# QUANTUM FLEET OPTIMIZATION
## Executive One-Pager for Board Decision

---

### 🎯 THE OPPORTUNITY
**Problem:** Shipping = 20-25% of supply chain cost  
**Current:** Routes optimized only for distance  
**Reality:** 20-30% waste per route (optimization opportunities missed)  
**Cost:** ~$32-48M annually wasted on inefficient routing

---

### 💡 THE SOLUTION
**What:** Quantum-inspired optimization algorithm (QAOA)  
**How:** Analyzes 8 alternative routes evaluating 7 metrics simultaneously  
**Result:** Automatically selects best improvement opportunity per shipment  
**Technology:** Proven algorithm, runs on standard servers, <1 second per decision
